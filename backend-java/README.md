# backend-java

Spring Boot starter API implementing the same reservation endpoints (in-memory) for demonstration.

Run (PowerShell):
```
cd backend-java
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Notes:
- This is a minimal in-memory example. For production, add a database, security, request validation, and rate limiting.
